custom edit/rebuild from Bortis n64 Amp https://github.com/borti4938 thx Borti 

features:

-composite sync on Video -> Multi AV (Pin 9) -> compatible with every RGB Cable

-THS7374 Amplifier 4 channels

-LowPass Filter (enabled by closing the jumper)

-composite sync filtered by 330uF

Makes it easier to use RGB cables with n64 (pal/ntsc) rgb mods or ntsc consoles with vdc-nus chip.

(Consoles with denc,mav or avdc nus need also a rgb mod.)
